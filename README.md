# STATS_302_Final

This is Final Project for STATS 302

output_3 is trained from face segmented data set, original data set is 'age'

output_4 is also trained from face segmented data set, original data set is 'age' but with more elder data, those with less than 100 will be doubled by flipped. I also change 'mpimg.imread' to 'cv2.imread' for unifying standard.
